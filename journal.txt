Section 0202

Week 1
This week I used AI to help me remember concepts and what certain variables are. I also use AI to explain how to use a specific statements such as if and else statements. Here is my chat link: https://chatgpt.com/share/68c742e0-68e0-800f-a13a-3041148cd04b.
I didn't use AI to complete the questions or for any debugging. As shown in the link a question that I asked ChatGPT was to explain boolean expressions. 
Currently I am using ChatGPT but a TA in our section recommended Claude which I something that I recently tried using. I'm still getting used to it, I like the format, but I need to use it more to be able to compare it better to ChatGPT. I remember from the professors examples, he was able to get better results from Claude than Gemini, but it was due to information that Claude had the prompt he gave it.

Week 2
I used AI to help me understand more concepts in Python. There were concpets in the assingment that I needed a refresher on. These are my ChatGPT conversation:    https://chatgpt.com/share/68d078e6-aa48-800f-a27d-b01f76e2cb73

For example, I needed to understand the concept of sorted in Python. 
In the beginning, I didn' know what the code for making something in alphabetical order so I had to ask ChatGPT: "What is the code for making something alphabetical."
I think ChatGPT can be very helpful when it comes to Python as it can not only give a explination of the code but also show you example codes.
I also used it to remind myself how to remove something from a list, how to use i in range, and how to slice a list.
